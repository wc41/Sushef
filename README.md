sushef

sushef is a multiplayer AR game where players can grab sushi ingredients off a conveyor belt and make sushi. 
The game requires a master client (preferably a PC) and two mobile clients. The mobile clients scan an image target to join and get positioned into the room. Once in the room, players get to optimal playing positions and a workstation will spawn for each player, and the game starts once both players are in position. 

There are four components on a player's workstation. To make a sushi, the player will grab ingredients off of the conveyor belt and drop it on their workstation board. With the correct ingredients, a sushi will be made once the player holds onto the creation board for a moment. Then, the player can drag and drop the sushi into the finished plate area on their workstation to submit. Any extra ingredient or sushi can be dragged and dropped to the workstation's trash area to get disposed, and finally the player can tap the workstation's recipe book to read the recipes via a pop up. 

Once a round begins, players will recipe a list of sushi items to make for the round. The round ends when one player completes their list first by making and submitting their sushis.
